## Running Code
If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise.
2. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080
(or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
